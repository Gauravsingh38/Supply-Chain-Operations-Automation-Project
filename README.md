# 📦 Amazon Supply Chain Operations & Automation Project

## 🚀 Overview

This project automates and analyzes Amazon-style supply chain operations by leveraging:

- **Supabase** (PostgreSQL backend)  
- **n8n.io** (Workflow automation)  
- **Quadratic** (Spreadsheet-like data analysis)  
- **Gmail API**, **CSV ingestion**, and **Python preprocessing**  

The pipeline helps monitor KPIs such as **OTIF %**, **Line Fill Rate**, **Volume Fill Rate**, and **Delivery Delays**, mimicking real-world warehouse and distribution metrics used at Amazon.

## 🧠 Key Features

✅ Automated Data Ingestion from different regions (US, Ahmedabad, Vadodara) via CSV files  
✅ AI Workflow Automation using n8n.io to parse and insert data into Supabase DB  
✅ Data Modeling with normalized tables for orders, products, and customers  
✅ Business Insights generation with Quadratic to uncover delivery bottlenecks and revenue loss  
✅ Supply Chain KPI Dashboards using industry-standard metrics
